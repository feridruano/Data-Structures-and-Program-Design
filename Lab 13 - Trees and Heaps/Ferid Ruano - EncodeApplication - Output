Creating 5 initial trees
Building Huffman Tree
--->Smallest tree moved to the position 4
--->Second smallest tree moved to the position 3
--->Combined tree created: [ , D] -> 2
--->Combined tree added at position 3
--->Smallest tree moved to the position 3
--->Second smallest tree moved to the position 2
--->Combined tree created: [J, i] -> 3
--->Combined tree added at position 2
--->Smallest tree moved to the position 2
--->Second smallest tree moved to the position 1
--->Combined tree created: [ , D, l] -> 6
--->Combined tree added at position 1
--->Smallest tree moved to the position 1
--->Second smallest tree moved to the position 0
--->Combined tree created: [J, i,  , D, l] -> 9
--->Combined tree added at position 0

Huffman Tree:
[J, i,  , D, l] -> 9
[J, i,  , D, l] -> 3
[J, i,  , D, l] -> 1
[i] -> 2
[ , D, l] -> 6
[ , D, l] -> 2
[ , D, l] -> 1
[D] -> 1
[l] -> 4
