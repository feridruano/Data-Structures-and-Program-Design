--> Creating aSet with the secondary constructor - capacity of 8
--> Adding elements from inputData to aSet
There are 4 string(s): A B C D 

--> Clearing aSet
The set is empty
--> aSet isEmpty returns 
true
--> The number of elements in aSet is 
0

--> Creating set1 with default constructor
--> set1 initially empty
The set is empty

--> Adding elements to set1
--> set1 after adding elements
There are 3 string(s): A B C 

--> Adding elements to set1

--> set1 after adding more elements
There are 10 string(s): A B C V T U W X Y Z 

--> set1 contains "A":
true
--> set1 contains "E":
false

--> Removing "B" from set1
--> After removing "B" from set1:
There are 9 string(s): A Z C V T U W X Y 
--> Removing random element from set1
--> After removing "Y" from set1:
There are 8 string(s): A Z C V T U W X 

--> Trying to remove "Q" from set1
--> After trying to remove non-existent element "Q" from set1:
There are 8 string(s): A Z C V T U W X 

--> Adding 4 elements to set1
--> After adding 4 elements to set1:
There are 12 string(s): A Z C V T U W X K L M N 
--> Adding 1 element to set1
--> After adding 1 more element to set1:
There are 13 string(s): A Z C V T U W X K L M N O 

--> Creating set2 with the secondary constructor that takes an array as input
There are 4 string(s): A B C D 
--> Adding more elements to set2
--> set2 after adding:
There are 8 string(s): A B C D E F G H 

Trying to add null entry
--> set2 after adding:
There are 8 string(s): A B C D E F G H 

Process finished with exit code 0
